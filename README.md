# Problem statement

Use OpenCV Object tracking to make Trafficc Management System. 

Use appropriate Road footage. ( I Managed to get one from the video website pexels.com)

Track only Heavy vehicles (like car, bus, truck, etc.) from Traffic with all types of vehicles (including bikes, bicycle, people, etc.). 

Return the tracked co-ordinates for each object separately.



#

Some other useful applications of Code can be in Keeping tracks of objects on conveyor belt, Cheacking Object Trajectory, Counting people in certain area, other traffic scenarios, etc.
